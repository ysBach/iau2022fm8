# Request to Chairperson

## Before the presentation
1. The Chairmen are all remote. Note that there will be a Co-Chairman at the meeting room in BEXCO to support the Chairman. Please organize the session in a quiet environment with a good network environment.
2. Please be well aware of the time allocation of each speaker (presentation and Q&A session) in advance. It is different from person to person. Having a clock in your hand would be nice to keep time punctual.
3. Please remind all remote audiences on zoom to mute their microphones except for the speaker.
4. When a presentation time comes, please call out the title and the speaker's name. And then (i) ask to share their screen via zoom function in case of remote presentation, or (i) request LOCs to set up the computer in case of in-person presentation.
5. If the zoom share by the remote speaker does not work, ask the LOCs to switch to a presentation using a local backup file.

## During the presentation
1. Pay attention if the zoom participants mute their microphone.

## After the presentation
1. Encourage the participants to ask questions and comments, asking the online participants to use the "raise hand" function. Please also ask Co-Chairman if there are any questions from in-person participants in the meeting room.
2. In addition, there will be comments on the chat board on zoom. If there is extra time for the Q&A session, please read out the questions on the chat board.
3. If more time is left for the Q&A session, please ask a question. If there are questions and comments beyond the time limit, please encourage them to discuss the contents separately on the chat board or Slack.

# Request to Co-Chairperson

## Before the presentation
1. Please come to the meeting room 15 minutes before the session starts. Let's have a brief meeting between the staff provided by the GA side and the LOCs (Moon, Ishiguro, HJLee, Bach, and Geem) regarding the organization.
2. Please let the remote Chairperman proceed with the session, basically.

## During the presentation
1. If the zoom share by the remote speaker does not work, ask the staff to prepare for screen sharing with a backup file stored on the local computer in the meeting room. If the remote speaker cannot manage screen sharing for more than ~2 minutes, please ask the remote speaker and Chairman to start the presentation using the backup file.

## After the presentation
1. During the Q&A session, please overlook the meeting room if someone has a question. Because Chairman cannot know the person with questions and comments in the meeting room, please let the Chairman know the questions from the meeting room. The Co-Chairman is supposed to nominate the persons with the questions.
2. It is expected that some audience will post questions on the chat board; Please assist the Chairman in making sure the comments are on the chat board.

# e-Poster Presenters

* You can access your e-Poster at ``e-Poster Gallery`` at the official website ([Direct link to FM8 e-Posters](https://www.iauga2022.org/program/program_12.asp?sMenu=abo12&subCate=B&sch_session=15&perPage=9&page=1)). 
* We reserved three monitors (displays) in the Conference Hall. 
* We allocate your e-Poster core time in the **timeslots** written in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19wTkitOYZKLuY27WhNHv6kSKkr_jcNtPZO_r6xfRgCA/edit?usp=sharing). 
* Please keep your schedule open during your core time.

Instructions on how to access the monitors will be provided to you as soon as we receive the information from IAUGA LOCs.
